There are several ways which can be employees to check your <a href="http://www.epfbalancestatus.in/epf-balance/" target="_blank">EPF balance</a>. One such way which comes in handy at times when you do not have an active online connection is via SMS or missed calls. For this you will need to have an activated UAN number. In case you have a valid UAN, your mobile number too will be registered with the <a href="http://epfo.services">EPF </a>department. Giving a simple missed call to 011-22901406 will ensure that you receive an SMS that lists down your <a href="http://www.epfindia.com/site_en/KYEPFB.php" target="_blank">PF</a> number, age and name as per the EPF records. However, you will require your UAN along with Aadhar Number or PAN Number in order to know your <a href="http://epfologin.com" target="_blank">EPFO login</a> balance.

KYC details along with UAN is mandatory for knowing your EPF balance. Once your <a href="http://uanlogin.in">UAN </a>is integrated with your KYC, every time you give a missed call to the Employeeâ€™s Provident Fund department, you will receive SMS with your EPF details including the EPF balance.
